Loading and pre-processing the data
```{r}
#Read the csv file
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
#First, calculate the total number of steps taken on a date (day)
totalsteps_perday <- aggregate(activity_data$steps, list(activity_data$date), FUN=sum)$x
#Then, plot the histogram of total steps taken per day
h <- hist(totalsteps_perday, plot = FALSE)
plot(h, 
     xlab = 'Total number of steps taken per day', 
     main = 'Histogram: Steps per day', 
     col = 'green')

#Finally, print the mean and median
cat('Mean of the total number of steps taken per day: ', mean(totalsteps_perday, na.rm = TRUE)); cat('\n')
cat('Median of the total number of steps taken per day: ', median(totalsteps_perday, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
